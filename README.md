# Landscape of sounds

A musical performance procedurally generated. Each instruments play sounds with random variations, following a sheet created at launch.
It uses the library [Pizzicato](https://alemangui.github.io/pizzicato/) to create instruments from oscillators and effects, as well as [teoria](https://github.com/saebekassebil/teoria) to write music.

This project is currently on hiatus. Too many technical issues got in the way, and after working on this for nearly six months I decided to pause it in favor of other projects. I might work on it again someday, or use some of its concept in other games.

## Launch

```
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a server on localhost:8080.
